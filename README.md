# Constructors-Word-Guess

This game demonstrates my knowledge of node.js and incorporates the inquire function while looping through an array of values that are randomly choosen - the user is than asked to guess the letters and is given in an attempt to accurately guess the game.

This is not fully completed and is in progress and will be completed soon.

I believe that most of the logic is sound I just need to update some things to make it all work.
